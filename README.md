# Challenge - Strategy

## Whay does this repository exist?
In addition to being a requirement for joining the back-end area of Incluir Technology, this repository was developed with the aim of studying the PHP language, the slim framework and the Strategy Pattern design pattern.

## What is the Strategy challenge?
The challenge asks to implement a system using the Strategy pattern to display different messages according to the day of the week. As an increment, an API was added that will show if that day is a national holiday or not.

In the end, a scheduling API was developed based on the idea of the application.
